### New features

- Improved reporting of notebook execution errors in GitHub check runs.

  - Uncaught exceptions in the notebook now result in a failure of the GitHub check run. The exception message is included in the check run output.

  - For timeouts, we now distinguish between notebook execution timeouts and GitHub check run timeouts.

  - For internal noteburst errors, we now show the full exception class to help with debugging.

### Bug fixes

### Other changes

- Adopt uv's dependency-groups and uv.lock for dependency management. This replaces the previous use of pip-tools compile to generate requirement/main.txt and dev.txt files of pinned dependencies.
