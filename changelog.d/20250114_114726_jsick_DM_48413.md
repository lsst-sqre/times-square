### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Migrate the database to use `TEXT` column types where previously we used `VARCHAR` columns with a (now unnecessary) length limit. **This change requires a database migration on deployment**. In Postgres there is no functional or performance difference between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` columns. This change simplifies the database schema and reduce the risk of future issues with column length limits.

### New features

-

### Bug fixes

- In the `cli` tox environment, fix the name of the executable to be `times-square` rather than `timessquare`.

### Other changes

- Improved the developer documentation for database migration to concretely provide copy-and-paste-able commands for preparing and running database migrations.
