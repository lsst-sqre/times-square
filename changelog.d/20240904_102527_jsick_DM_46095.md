### Backwards-incompatible changes

-

### New features

- Improved feedback in GitHub Check Runs:

  - If a YAML file has bad syntax causing a parsing error, we now post the YAML error as a check run annotation â€” including the location of the error in the file.

### Bug fixes

-

### Other changes

- The GitHub Check Run service methods are now part of a new `GitHubCheckRunService` class, separate from the `GitHubRepoService`. This internal change helps clarify what functionality is needed for the GitHub Checks functionality, as opposed to syncing data with GitHub repositories.
