### Backwards-incompatible changes

- This release requires a database schema migration to `747a655bacf6`.

### New features

- Pages can now be scheduled to run automatically. This is useful for preparing reports and creating dashboards on a regular basis. Scheduled page runs use the page's default parameter values, and replace any pre-cached results. Scheduling works great in combination with dynamic defaults for date parameters, which allows you to compute a notebook for a specific day, while still keeping historical results.

  Schedules are set up in the notebook's YAML sidecar file with the `schedule` and `schedule_enabled` keys. An example of a schedule that runs every day at 08:00 UTC:

  ```yaml
  schedule:
    - freq: "daily"
      hour: 8
      minute: 0
  schedule_enabled: true
  ```

  A more sophisticated schedule that runs on the last day of every month at 23:59 UTC:

  ```yaml
  schedule:
    - freq: "monthly"
      day: -1
      hour: 23
      minute: 59
  schedule_enabled: true
  ```

  More scheduling options are available that can accommodate almost any imaginable cadence.
  See the documentation for details.
