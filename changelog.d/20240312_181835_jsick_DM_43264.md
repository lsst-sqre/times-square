### New features

- We've adopted Safir's `safir.fastapi.ClientRequestError` so that errors like 404 and 422 (input validation) now use the same error format as FastAPI uses for its built-in model validation errors. For parameter errors from endpoints like `GET /v1/pages:page/html` the parameter name is now part of the `loc` field in the error message.
- Times Square and its worker now send uncaught exceptions to a Slack webhook for better error reporting. The webhook URL is set in the `TS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.
