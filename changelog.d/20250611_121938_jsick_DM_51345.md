### New features

- Added a new `dayobs-date` parameter format. This is similar to the original `dayobs` format in the use of the UTC-12 timezone, but expects dates in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format and adds the parameters as `datetime.date` values in the notebook. Although this is not the standard usage of `dayobs`, it may be useful for many applications because the string format is more readable and the `datetime.date` type is more convenient to use in Python code. `dayobs-date` works with dynamic defaults like `dayobs` and standard date formats.
