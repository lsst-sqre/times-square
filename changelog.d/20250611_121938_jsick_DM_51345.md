### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The `dayobs` parameter format now creates an int value in the notebook rather than a string. For example, it now generates `myvar = 20250115` instead of `myvar = '20250115'`. This is a better match for the dayobs metadata standard described in [SITCOMTN-032](https://sitcomtn-032.lsst.io).

### New features

- Added a new `dayobs-date` parameter format. This is similar to the original `dayobs` format in the use of the UTC-12 timezone, but expects dates in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format and adds the parameters as `datetime.date` values in the notebook. Although this is not the standard usage of `dayobs`, it may be useful for many applications because the string format is more readable and the `datetime.date` type is more convenient to use in Python code. `dayobs-date` works with dynamic defaults like `dayobs` and standard date formats.
