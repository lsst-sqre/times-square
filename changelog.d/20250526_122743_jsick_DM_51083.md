### New features

- Date parameters can now take a "dynamic_default" value, which causes the default value of that parameter to be a date relative to the date when the page is viewed. To use a dynamic default in a date parameter in a notebook's sidecar YAML file, replace the "default" field with "dynamic_default". The dynamic default can be:

  - "today"
  - "yesterday"
  - "tomorrow"
  - A relative number of days earlier (e.g., "-5d" for 5 days ago) or later (e.g., "+3d" for 3 days in the future)
  - A relative number of weeks (e.g. "-2weeks" for 2 weeks ago), months (e.g. "+1month" for 1 month in the future), or years (e.g. "-1year" for 1 year ago)
  - The first day of the week/month/year ("week_start", "month_start", "year_start"), or a number of periods into the past or future (e.g., "-1week_start" for the start of previous week, "+2month_start" for the start of next month).
  - The last day of the week/month/year ("week_end", "month_end", "year_end"), or a number of periods into the past or future (e.g., "-1week_end" for the end of previous week, "+2month_end" for the end of next month).
