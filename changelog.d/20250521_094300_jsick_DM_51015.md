### New features

- Times Square now pre-processes notebooks with [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). This has two benefits:

  1. Nbstripout removes the `kernelspec` metadata from notebooks, which can cause issues when a notebook is made with a different kernel than the one that Times Square uses for notebook execution in the Rubin Science Platform. All notebooks now run under the `lsst` kernel.

  2. Nbstripout removes outputs from the notebooks, in cases where outputs are committed to their Git repository. This improves the performance for storing and transferring notebooks in the system.

  Although Times Square now uses nbstripout internally, it is still a good idea for authors to run nbstripout as a pre-commit hook in their own repositories to improve their own development processes.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the capitalization of the `lsst` kernel name. Previously it was `LSST`, which is the _display name_, but not the _kernel name_. This is relevant now that [Noteburst uses the specified kernel name to run notebooks](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/noteburst/pull/121).
