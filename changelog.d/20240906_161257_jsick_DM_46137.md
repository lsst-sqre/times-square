### New features

- Times Square enforces a timeout when polling for Noteburst results during a GitHub Check run. This prevents the Check Run from hanging indefinitely if the Noteburst service is unable to time out a notebook execution. This timeout is configurable via the `TS_CHECK_RUN_TIMEOUT` environment variable. The default timeout is 300 seconds.
