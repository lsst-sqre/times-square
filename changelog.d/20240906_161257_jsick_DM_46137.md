### New features

- Times Square now specifies a timeout for notebook executions with Noteburst. This provides better feedback for notebook executions that have hung, either when rendering new pages for users, for when doing a GitHub Check Run. Currently this timeout is set app-wide with the `TS_DEFAULT_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` environment variable. The default timeout is 60 seconds. In the future we intend to add per-notebook timeout configuration.

- Times Square enforces a timeout when polling for Noteburst results during a GitHub Check run. This prevents the Check Run from hanging indefinitely if the Noteburst service is unable to time out a notebook execution or fails for any reason. This timeout is configurable via the `TS_CHECK_RUN_TIMEOUT` environment variable. The default timeout is 600 seconds.
